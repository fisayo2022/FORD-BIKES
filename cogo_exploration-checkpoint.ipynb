    "## Introduction\n",
    "The [Cogo Bike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoGo) Share system launched in July 2013 with a network of 300 bicycles and 30 stations located throughout downtown Columbus. Today, CoGo boasts around 90 stations and 600 bikes serving Columbus, Bexley, Upper Arlington, Grandview Heights and Easton. The system provides Columbus residents and visitors an additional transportation option for getting around town that is fun, easy, and affordable. \n",
    "\n",
    "CoGo is available for use 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and includes both classic pedal bikes and electric assist ebikes. The station network provides twice as many docking points as bicycles, assuring that an available dock to return your bicycle is always nearby.
